 Part  2—Farm household allowance  
Division  1—Simplified outline  of this Part  
7  Simplified outline of this Part  
Farm household allowance is payable to certain farmers and their 
partners.  A person must qualify for farm household allowance for 
the allowance to be payable. The allowance is payable for a 
cumulative period of up to 4 years  in each specified 10 year period . 
To qualify for the allowance as a farmer, a person must contribute 
signi ficant labour and capital to a farm enterprise that has a 
significant commercial purpose or character. The partner of such a 
person may also qualify for the allowance.  
Another requirement for a person to qualify for the allowance is 
that the person is will ing to enter into a financial improvement 
agreement. A financial improvement agreement sets out the 
activities that the person must do for the purposes of the activity 
test (which is a test that a person to whom the allowance is payable 
is generally requir ed to satisfy). The kinds of activities that may be 
set out in a financial improvement agreement include receiving 
training or advice from an appropriately qualified person, or 
undertaking study.  
In certain circumstances, a person may be exempt from the ac tivity 
test (for example, during periods that are essential to the operation 
of the farm or if a person is temporarily incapacitated).  
Even if a person qualifies for farm household allowance, the 
allowance may not be payable (such as where the value of the  
person ’s assets exceeds a certain limit, where the person receives 
other support under the Social Security Act or where the person is 
subject to a waiting period).

 Farm household allowance may continue to be payable during a 
person ’s period of absence fro m Australia. (The period is generally 
no longer than 6 weeks.)  
A person ’s rate of farm household allowance depends on the age of 
the person. For a person who has not turned 22, the rate is worked 
out using the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in the Social 
Security Act. Otherwise, the rate is worked out using the Benefit 
Rate Calculator B in that Act (which is also used to work out 
jobseeker payment ). Some modifications are made to the 
Calculators for the purposes of farm household allowance.  
There are certa in obligations imposed on a person to whom farm 
household allowance is payable. Farm household allowance may 
cease to be payable to a person who fails to comply with these 
obligations.  
The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are 
made and re view of decisions relating to farm household allowance 
are found in the Social Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act. (This is because Part  5 of this Act applies and 
modifies the Social Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act in relation to farm household allowance.)

the assessment . 
The amount of the supplement is the cost of the far m financial 
assessment (up to a maximum amou nt). 
Farm household allowance may not be payable if a person fails to 
comply with a requirement to have a farm financial assessment 
conducted.  
The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are 
made and review of decisions relating to the suppleme nt are found

 Part  5—Application and m odification of the Social 
Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act  
Division  1—Introduction  
90  Simplified outline of this Part  
This Part notionally modifies how the Social Security Act and the 
Social Security Administration Act operate, so that those Acts can 
apply in relation to payments made under this Act.  
Farm household allowance is generally treated in the same way as 
jobseeker payment and youth allowance. This means that where 
there is a reference in thos e Acts to jobseeker payment or youth 
allowance, it is as if there were also a reference to farm household 
allowance. Similarly, where there is a reference to a concept that is 
defined to include jobseeker payment or youth allowance, such as 
“social securit y benefit” or “social security payment”, it is as if that 
concept were also defined to include farm household allowance.  
The farm household allowance, the activity supplement, the farm 
financial assessment supplement, the FHA supplement and a relief 
paymen t are all treated as if they were social security payments. As 
a result, the general rules in the Social Security Act and Social 
Security Administration Act relating to claims, how payments are 
made and review of decisions apply in relation to payments und er 
this Act.  
In order for those Acts to operate appropriately in relation to this 
Act, some provisions of those Acts are notionally turned off, and 
the text of other provisions of the Acts is notionally changed.

 The modifications of concepts in the Social Security Act and the 
Social Security Administration Act flow through to other Acts, 
such as the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936  and the Income Tax 
Assessment Act 1997  as a result of this Part.  
91  Purposes of this Part  
 (1) This Part modifies the Social Sec urity Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act  so that those Acts apply  in relation to payments 
made under this Act.  
 (2) The modifications apply  for the purposes of the following Acts  
(including any regulations or other legislative instruments made 
under those Acts) : 
 (a) this Act;  
 (b) the Social Security Act;  
 (c) the Social Security Administration Act;  
 (d) any other Act that refers to the Social Security Act  or the 
Social Security Administration Act . 
 (3) To avoid doubt, when an Act (the relevant  Act) other than the 
Social Security Act:  
 (a) uses an expression that  is also used in all or part of the Social 
Security Act; and  
 (b) gives the expression the same meaning as in th at Act or part ; 
and 
 (c) the expression is modified by section  93 of this Act ; 
the expression when used in the relevant Act has the modified 
meaning.  
Example:  Subsection  3(2) of the Social Security Administration Act gives 
expressions used in that Act the same meaning as in the Social 
Security Act . So, for example, a  reference in the Social Security 
Administration Act to a social security payment is taken, as a result of 
this Part, to include a reference to farm household allowance, activity 
supplement, farm financial assessment supplement, FHA supplement 
and relief paym ent.
