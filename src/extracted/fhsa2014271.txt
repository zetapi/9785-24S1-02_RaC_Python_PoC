Part 2-Farm household allowance
Division 1-Simplified outline of this Part
7  Simplified outline of this Part
Farm household allowance is payable to certain farmers and their 
partners. A person must qualify for farm household allowance for 
the allowance to be payable. The allowance is payable for a 
cumulative period of up to 3 years.
To qualify for the allowance as a farmer, a person must contribute 
significant labour and capital to a farm enterprise that has a 
significant commercial purpose or character. The partner of such a 
person may also qualify for the allowance.
Another requirement for a person to qualify for the allowance is 
that the person is willing to enter into a financial improvement 
agreement. A financial improvement agreement sets out the 
activities that the person must do for the purposes of the activity 
test (which is a test that a person to whom the allowance is payable 
is generally required to satisfy). The kinds of activities that may be 
set out in a financial improvement agreement include receiving 
training or advice from an appropriately qualified person, or 
undertaking study.
In certain circumstances, a person may be exempt from the activity 
test (for example, during periods that are essential to the operation 
of the farm or if a person is temporarily incapacitated).
Even if a person qualifies for farm household allowance, the 
allowance may not be payable (such as where the value of the 
person's assets exceeds a certain limit, where the person receives 
other support under the Social Security Act or where the person is 
subject to a waiting period).
Farm household allowance may continue to be payable during a 
person's period of absence from Australia. (The period is generally 
no longer than 6 weeks.)
A person's rate of farm household allowance depends on the age of 
the person. For a person who has not turned 22, the rate is worked 
out using the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in the Social 
Security Act. Otherwise, the rate is worked out using the Benefit 
Rate Calculator B in that Act (which is also used to work out 
newstart allowance). Some modifications are made to the 
Calculators for the purposes of farm household allowance.
There are certain obligations imposed on a person to whom farm 
household allowance is payable. Farm household allowance may 
cease to be payable to a person who fails to comply with these 
obligations.
The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are 
made and review of decisions relating to farm household allowance 
are found in the Social Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act. (This is because Part 5 of this Act applies and 
modifies the Social Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act in relation to farm household allowance.)
Division 2-Basic qualifications of farmers and their

Note 3:	This section is subject to sections 10 (grace period for farmers' 
partners) and 12 (no effective control of farm enterprises).
10  Grace period for farmers' partners
	(1)	This section applies if:
	(a)	a person was qualified for farm household allowance under 
section 9 as a partner of a farmer; and
	(b)	the person would (apart from this section) have ceased to be 
qualified for farm household allowance on a day (the grace 
period start day) only because:
	(i)	the person ceased to be a member of a couple on that 
day; or
	(ii)	the person's partner was in gaol or undergoing 
psychiatric confinement on that day, and could not 
contribute a significant part of his or her labour or 
capital to a farm enterprise as a result of the 
imprisonment or confinement.
	(2)	The person remains qualified under section 9 for farm household 
allowance for the period:
	(a)	starting on the grace period start day; and
	(b)	ending on the earlier of the following days:
	(i)	the day the person otherwise ceases to be qualified for 
farm household allowance under that section;
	(ii)	the day that is 14 weeks after the grace period start day.
11  Persons with temporary incapacity exemption may be taken to 
meet the labour requirement
		A person who is exempt from the activity test under section 31 
(temporary incapacity) for a period is taken to contribute a 
significant part of his or her labour to a farm enterprise during the 
period if the person contributed a significant part of his or her 
labour to the farm enterprise immediately before becoming 
incapacitated.
12  Persons not qualified if Secretary determines that they do not 
effectively control farm enterprises
	(1)	A person is not qualified, or ceases to be qualified, for farm 
household allowance for a period if the Secretary determines that:
	(a)	during the period:
	(i)	for a person who qualifies under section 8 as a farmer-
the person is not effectively in control of the farm or 
farm enterprise in relation to which the person claims 
the allowance; or
	(ii)	for a person who qualifies under section 9 as a partner 
of a farmer-the farmer is not effectively in control of 
the farm or farm enterprise in relation to which the 
person claims the allowance; and
	(b)	farm household allowance should not be payable to the 
person for the period.
Note	Some examples of cases in which the Secretary may consider that a 
person is not effectively in control of a farm or farm enterprise are 
when a mortgagee has taken possession of a farm, when a person is a 
bankrupt or when an eviction notice has been served on a person in 
respect of a farm.
	(2)	A person may effectively be in control of a farm enterprise that is a 
designated private trust even if the person does not pass the control 
test in relation to the farm enterprise under section 1207V of the 
Social Security Act.
13  Determination of matters relating to qualification for farm 
household allowance
	(1)	The Secretary's rules may prescribe matters the Secretary must 
take into account in deciding whether the requirement in 
paragraph 8(b) or (c), or paragraph 9(d) or (e), is met.
	(2)	To avoid doubt, the Secretary's rules do not limit the matters the 
Secretary may take into account in deciding whether the 
requirement is met.
Division 3-Financial improvement agreements
14  Requirement to enter financial improvement agreement
	(1)	The Secretary may require a person to enter a financial 
improvement agreement if:
	(a)	such an agreement is not already in force in relation to the 
person; and
	(b)	either:
	(i)	the person is receiving, or has made a claim for, farm 
household allowance; or
	(ii)	the Department is contacted by or on behalf of the 
person in relation to a claim for farm household 
allowance.
	(2)	The Secretary may require a person to enter into another financial 
improvement agreement if a financial improvement agreement is 
already in force in relation to the person.
Note:	The earlier financial improvement agreement is cancelled in 
accordance with section 17.
Giving notice of requirement
	(3)	The Secretary must give a person who is required to enter a 
financial improvement agreement written notice of:
	(a)	the requirement; and
	(b)	the places and times at which the agreement is to be 
negotiated; and
	(c)	the period (of not more than 28 days) within which the 
person must comply with the notice; and
	(d)	a description of consequences that may apply if the person 
does not comply with the notice.

Note:	For the activities that may be undertaken, see section 19.
	(2)	A financial improvement agreement must not contain a 
requirement of a kind prescribed by the Secretary's rules for the

discretion to exclude other kinds of requirements from a particular 
financial improvement agreement under subsection (1).

	(4)	A financial improvement agreement may also contain one or more 
terms that the person may, but is not required to, comply with.

	(3)	Despite subsection (2), the Secretary may determine that a person 
is not subject to the whole, or any part, of the preclusion period if

work preclusion period (whether in relation to the claim referred to 
in subsection (1) or any other claim under the Social Security Act).
	(4)	The Secretary's rules may set out ways for substantiating 
unavoidable or reasonable expenditure.
Division 7-Overseas portability
49  Division does not affect need for qualification
		To avoid doubt, nothing in this Division confers a right on a person

in working out the rate of farm household allowance for a person, 
if:

	(1)	If:
	(a)	a person's rate of farm household allowance is required to be 
determined for the purposes of the Social Security 
Administration Act (as it applies because of Part 5 of this 
Act); and
	(b)	information about the amount of the person's business 
income needed for the determination of the rate is not 
available (for example, because the business income of the 
person cannot be known until after the end of the relevant 
income year); and
	(c)	the person, or if the person has died, another person making a 
claim under that Act (as so applied) gives the Secretary an 
estimate of the person's business income; and
	(d)	the Secretary considers the estimate to be reasonable;
the Secretary may determine the person's rate of farm household 
allowance on the basis of the estimate, to the extent that the rate is 
affected by the amount of the person's business income.
	(2)	The rate cannot be determined if the Secretary does not consider 
the estimate reasonable.
	(3)	A person's business income is ordinary income of the person in 
the form of profits from a business carried on by the person.
69  Date of effect of determinations based on estimates of business 
income

person as a result of a decision (the original decision) that 
was based, wholly or partly, on an estimate of a person's 
business income; and
	(b)	the Secretary makes a determination (the new 
determination), relating to the allowance, under Subdivision 
A of Division 7 of Part 3 of the Social Security 
Administration Act (as it applies because of Part 5 of this 
Act), whether or not the new determination is the first such 
determination; and
	(c)	the reason, or one of the reasons, for making the new 
determination is that the Secretary considers that:
	(i)	information about the amount of the person's business 
income is now available; and
	(ii)	the person's business income differs from the estimate 
on which the original decision was wholly or partly 
based;
the new determination takes effect on the day the determination 
embodying the original decision took effect, or on the first day of 
the financial year to which subsection (2) applies, whichever is 
later.
	(2)	This subsection applies to:
	(a)	the financial year preceding the financial year in which the 
new determination was made; or
	(b)	if the Secretary specifies an earlier financial year in the new 
determination-that earlier financial year.
	(3)	This section has effect despite Division 9 of Part 3 of the Social 
Security Administration Act (as it applies because of Part 5 of this 
Act), but does not affect the application of section 109 of that Act 
as so applied in relation to a review of the new determination.
	(4)	To avoid doubt, a person's entitlement to the benefit of a payment, 
for the purposes of section 1223 of the Social Security Act (as it 
applies because of Part 5 of this Act), is to be ascertained taking 
into account when any relevant new determinations take effect 
under this section.
70  Debts arising from payments of farm household allowance based 
on estimates of business income
	(1)	If:
	(a)	farm household allowance is being, or has been, paid to a

partly, on an estimate of a person's business income; and
	(b)	the person has not complied with a notice under section 68 or 
69 of the Social Security Administration Act (as it applies 
because of Part 5 of this Act); and
	(c)	the notice related to the person's business income during a 
particular period; and
	(d)	the Secretary is satisfied that, if the person had complied with 
the notice, information about the amount of the person's 
business income during the period could have been 
ascertained;
the amount of farm household allowance paid to the person in 
relation to the period is a debt due to the Commonwealth, and is 
taken, for the purposes of the Social Security Act, to have arisen 
under Part 5.2 of that Act.
	(2)	This section does not limit the application of Part 5.2 of the Social 
Security Act (as it applies because of Part 5 of this Act).
Division 9-Compliance with obligations in relation to 
farm household allowance
71  Qualification failures
	(1)	The Secretary may determine that a person commits a 
qualification failure if:
	(a)	the person fails to comply with a notice given under 
section 14 within the period specified in the notice

period that:
	(a)	begins on the day the Secretary makes a determination that

	(2)	A person ceases to be qualified for farm household allowance if:
	(a)	the Secretary makes a determination that the person has 
committed a qualification failure; and

beginning on the day the failure began.
73  Conduct failures

failure if the person has done any of the following:
	(a)	engaged in misconduct while undertaking an activity that is 
specified in the financial improvement agreement that is in 
force in relation to the person;
	(b)	refused or failed to accept an offer of suitable employment in 
accordance with a financial improvement agreement that is in 
force in relation to the person;
	(c)	an act that resulted (directly or indirectly) in the person 
becoming unemployed, and it was reasonably foreseeable 
that acting in that manner could result in the person 
becoming unemployed.
74  Consequences of conduct failures
		Farm household allowance is not payable to a person during the 
period that:
	(a)	begins on the day the Secretary makes a determination that 
the person has committed a conduct failure; and
	(b)	ends:
	(i)	if the Secretary revokes the determination under 
section 75-on the day mentioned in that section; or
	(ii)	otherwise-8 weeks after the period began.
75  Revoking a determination relating to a conduct failure
	(1)	The Secretary may revoke a determination that a person has 
committed a conduct failure if the Secretary determines that 
continuing the period referred to in section 74 would cause the 
person to be in severe financial hardship.
	(2)	The Secretary may make a determination under subsection (1) on 
request or on his or her own initiative.
	(3)	For the purposes of subparagraph 74(b)(i), the day the period ends 
is:
	(a)	if the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (1) 
of this section on request-the day before the request was 
made; or
	(b)	if the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (1) 
on his or her own initiative-the day before the Secretary 
makes the determination.
76  Reasonable excuses
	(1)	The Secretary must not make a determination that a person has 
committed a qualification failure or a conduct failure if the person 
satisfies the Secretary that the person has a reasonable excuse for 
the failure.
	(2)	A determination that a person has committed a qualification failure 
or a conduct failure is taken never to have been made if, after the 
Secretary makes the determination, the person satisfies the 
Secretary that the person had a reasonable excuse for the failure.
Secretary's rules
	(3)	The Secretary's rules may specify matters the Secretary must take 
into account in deciding whether a person has a reasonable excuse 
for committing a failure.
	(4)	To avoid doubt, the Secretary's rules do not limit the matters that 
the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether the person 
has a reasonable excuse.
Requirements for reasonable excuses
	(5)	 An excuse for failing to satisfy the activity test cannot be a 
reasonable excuse for the purposes of paragraph 71(1)(c) unless:
	(a)	before the start of the relevant activity on the day concerned, 
the person notified the excuse to the person or body specified 
in the financial improvement agreement as the person or 
body to whom prior notice should be given if the person is 
unable to undertake the activity; or
	(b)	the Secretary is satisfied that in those circumstances it would 
be unreasonable to expect the person to give the notification.
77  Day of determination
		For the purposes of sections 72 and 74 (consequences of 
qualification and conduct failures), the day the Secretary makes the 
determination is the day the Secretary originally makes the 
determination (even if another decision in relation to the 
determination is later made on review).
78  Relationship with section 80 of the Social Security 
Administration Act
		Nothing in this Division affects the power of the Secretary to 
cancel or suspend a payment of farm household allowance under 
section 80 of the Social Security Administration Act.
Part 3-Activity supplement
  
79  Simplified outline of this Part
A person to whom farm household allowance is payable may 
qualify for the activity supplement if he or she undertakes, or will 
undertake, an activity specified in the person's financial 
improvement agreement.
The person may elect to have the supplement paid directly to the 
person or to the service provider for the activity.
The person may be paid the activity supplement more than once. 
However, in total the person will receive no more than a maximum 
amount.
The amount of the supplement payable to the person is the cost of 
the activity (up to a maximum amount).
The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are 
made and review of decisions relating to the supplement are found 
in the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration 
Act. (This is because Part 5 of this Act applies the Social Security 
Act and the Social Security Administration Act in relation to the 
supplement.)

period of 2 months beginning on the day the invoice relating 
to the activity is provided by the service provider for the 
activity; and
	(h)	at the time the person lodges the claim for the supplement, 
the person gives the Secretary evidence or a declaration in a 
form approved by the Secretary that:

undertaken in accordance with section 20; and
	(ii)	if the person elects under section 81 for the supplement 
to be paid directly to the person-the person has paid 
the service provider for the activity; and
	(i)	the total amount of activity supplement that the person has 
previously been paid is less than the maximum amount of 
activity supplement.
Future activities

Part 4-Farm financial assessments
Division 1-Simplified outline of this Part
84  Simplified outline of this Part
The Secretary may require a person to have a farm financial 
assessment conducted if the person is receiving, or has made a 
claim for, farm household allowance.
A farm financial assessment is an assessment of the financial 
position of a farm enterprise, and the person for whom the 
assessment is conducted, and options for improving that financial 
position.
A farm financial assessment must be conducted by an independent 
prescribed adviser.
If a person has a farm financial assessment conducted, he or she 
may qualify for a farm financial assessment supplement, which 
may be paid directly to the person or to the adviser.
The amount of the supplement is the cost of the farm financial 
assessment (up to a maximum amount).
Farm household allowance may not be payable if a person fails to 
comply with a requirement to have a farm financial assessment 
conducted.
The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are 
made and review of decisions relating to the supplement are found 
in the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration 
Act. (This is because Part 5 of this Act applies the Social Security 
Act and the Social Security Administration Act in relation to the 
supplement.)

Part 5-Application and modification of the Social 
Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act
Division 1-Introduction
90  Simplified outline of this Part
This Part notionally modifies how the Social Security Act and the 
Social Security Administration Act operate, so that those Acts can 
apply in relation to payments made under this Act.
Farm household allowance is generally treated in the same way as 
newstart and youth allowance. This means that where there is a 
reference in those Acts to newstart or youth allowance, it is as if 
there were also a reference to farm household allowance. Similarly, 
where there is a reference to a concept that is defined to include 
those allowances, such as "social security benefit" or "social 
security payment", it is as if that concept were also defined to 
include farm household allowance.
The farm household allowance, the activity supplement and the 
farm financial assessment supplement are all treated as if they were 
social security payments. As a result, the general rules in the Social 
Security Act and Social Security Administration Act relating to 
how to make claims, how payments are made and review of 
decisions apply in relation payments under this Act.
In order for those Acts to operate appropriately in relation to this 
Act, some provisions of those Acts are notionally turned off, and 
the text of other provisions of the Acts is notionally changed.
The modifications of concepts in the Social Security Act and the 
Social Security Administration Act flow through to other Acts, 
such as the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax 
Assessment Act 1997 as a result of this Part.
91  Purposes of this Part
	(1)	This Part modifies the Social Security Act and the Social Security 
Administration Act so that those Acts apply in relation to payments 
made under this Act.
	(2)	The modifications apply for the purposes of the following Acts 
(including any regulations or other legislative instruments made 
under those Acts):
	(a)	this Act;
	(b)	the Social Security Act;
	(c)	the Social Security Administration Act;
	(d)	any other Act that refers to the Social Security Act or the 
Social Security Administration Act.
	(3)	To avoid doubt, when an Act (the relevant Act) other than the 
Social Security Act:
	(a)	uses an expression that is also used in all or part of the Social 
Security Act; and
	(b)	gives the expression the same meaning as in that Act or part; 
and
	(c)	the expression is modified by section 93 of this Act;
the expression when used in the relevant Act has the modified 
meaning.
Example:	Subsection 3(2) of the Social Security Administration Act gives 
expressions used in that Act the same meaning as in the Social 
Security Act. So, for example, a reference in the Social Security 
Administration Act to a social security payment is taken, as a result of 
this Part, to include a reference to farm household allowance, activity 
supplement and farm financial assessment supplement.
92  Further modification of the Social Security Act and the Social 
Security Administration Act
	(1)	The Minister's rules may provide that:
	(a)	this Part; or
	(b)	the Social Security Act; or
	(c)	the Social Security Administration Act;
has effect for the purposes set out in section 91 of this Act with any 
modifications that are prescribed.
	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister's rules may:
	(a)	prescribe additional provisions of the Social Security Act or 
the Social Security Administration Act that do not apply, or 
that apply with modifications that are prescribed, in relation 
to the operation of this Act; or
	(b)	prescribe provisions referred to in section 94 or 98 of this Act 
that, despite those sections, apply in relation to the operation 
of this Act; or
	(c)	make further modifications of provisions already modified by 
section 95 or 99 of this Act.

Administration Act, or in any instrument made under those Acts, is 
inappropriate (whether for administrative reasons or any other 
reason).
	(6)	The Secretary's rules may provide that the provision is to have 
effect as if:
	(a)	the reference to the Agriculture Secretary were a reference to 
the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Social Security
